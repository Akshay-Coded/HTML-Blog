I have incoporated basic CSS with HTML to style the page.I have added an sidebar which can navigate through the
blog page.all the contents are referred from the https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp website.
I used Jon Duckett's-"HTML and CSS" and w3schools website for reffering syntax and ideas for my blog.
The tags that were used in the code are p,h,section,article,title,pre,div,nav,ul,li,a,strong and style.
Simple CSS attributes like border, color, background-color, padding, margin, posistion and cursor etc. 
are used in the code to style the page.
